This is a demo basezf application, primarily developed to provide a clean
implementation of the Zend Framework.

INSTALLATION
=======================================================================
This application requires that you either have Zend Framework on your
include_path, or that you will be symlinking your Zend Framework library
into the library directory. If you do not yet have Zend Framework, you
can get it from one of the following sources:

  * Official Release:
    http://framework.zend.com/dowload/latest

  * Subversion; use either the current trunk or the 1.9.2 release branch:
    svn co http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/library/Zend

    svn co http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/branches/release-1.9.2/library/Zend

Install Zend Framework locally, and the follow these steps:

1. Run the config script and answer questions:

    cd <path_to_basezf>
    make config

2. Init your environment

    cp <path_to_basezf>/includes/auto_prepend_local.php-dist <path_to_basezf>/includes/auto_prepend_local.php
    set ZF_PATH value on <path_to_basezf>/includes/auto_prepend_local.php to Zend Framework path, without library at the end of path

2. Add Apache config generated by "make config":

    ln -s /path/to/<baszf>/etc/apache.conf /etc/apache2/site-available/001-basezf
    ln -s /etc/apache2/site-available/001-basezf /etc/apache2/site-enable/001-basezf


STRUCTURE
=======================================================================

   <path_to_basezf>/
    |
    |-> app/                        - This directory contains your application. It will house the MVC system, as well as conifgurations, services used, and your bootstrap file.
    |   |-> Bootstrap.php           - This file is the entry point for your application. The purpose for this file is to bootstrap the application and make components available to the application by initializing them. This file should not call dispatch() on the front controller.
    |   |-> controllers/
    |   |-> views/
    |       |-> filters/
    |       |-> helpers/            - These directories will contain view helpers. View helpers will be namespaced either as "App_View_Helper_"
    |       |-> layouts/            - This layout directory is for MCV-based layouts.
    |       |-> scripts/
    |
    |-> bin/
    |-> data/                       - This directory provides a place to store application data that is volatile and possibly temporary. The disturbance of data in this directory might cause the application to fail. Also, the information in this directory may or may not be committed to a subversion repository. Examples of things in this directory are session files, cache files, sqlite databases, logs and indexes.
    |-> doc/                        - This directory contains documentation, either generated or directly authored.
    |-> etc/                        - The application-wide configuration directory
    |-> includes/
    |-> lib/                        - This directory houses the Zend/library/Zend/* folder which contains Zend Framework. Developers should also place their application's library code under this directory in a separate namespace- ie, a namespace that does not begin with 'Zend'.
    |-> locale/
    |-> public/                     - This directory contains all public files for your application. index.php sets up the PHP environment, include the Bootstrap.php file from your app/ directory and finally dispatch() the front controller. The web root of your web server would typically be set to this directory.
    |-> sql/
    |-> tests/                      - This directory contains application tests. These could be hand written, phpunit tests, selenium based tests or based on some other testing framework. By default, library code can be tested by mimicing the directory structure of your library/ directory. Additionally, functional tests for your application could be written mimicing the application/ directory structure (including the application subdirectory).
